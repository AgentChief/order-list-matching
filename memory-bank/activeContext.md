# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**TASK015 - Documentation Foundation Cleanup**: CRITICAL foundation work to establish proper documentation structure, naming conventions (lowercase_underscore), and migrate plans from memory-bank to docs/. Required before TASK014 database consolidation can proceed safely.

## Recent Changes
**August 5**: **TASK015 CREATED** - Critical documentation foundation cleanup as prerequisite for database work
**August 5**: **TASK014 CREATED** - Critical database folder consolidation blocking TASK013
**August 5**: **TASK013 SCHEMA ANALYSIS COMPLETE** - Unified schema confirmed, movement table ready for implementation after cleanup
**August 3**: **TASK013 CREATED** - Strategic movement table approach designed building on existing infrastructure
**January 27, 2025**: **TASK001 COMPLETED** - Materialized cache deployed with performance validation passing all tests

## Next Steps
**CRITICAL FOUNDATION**: Execute TASK015 documentation cleanup immediately
- Establish standardized docs/ folder structure (architecture/, analysis/, plans/, etc.)
- Migrate plans from memory-bank/plans/ to docs/plans/ (business docs don't belong in AI memory)
- Rename ALL files to lowercase_underscore convention (eliminate capital letters and mixed formats)
- Consolidate sql/ folder into db/ddl/ structure  
- Create documentation standards and update all path references

**After TASK015**: Execute TASK014 database folder consolidation  
- Analyze 34 files in database/ vs 110 files in db/ for duplicates and outdated content
- Consolidate all database assets into single db/ folder structure
- Update all code references from database/ to db/ paths

**After TASK014**: Resume TASK013 movement table implementation
- Add match_group field to reconciliation_result table
- Create fact_order_movements table with event-driven structure

## Active Decisions and Considerations
**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Three-layer blocking chain discovered during comprehensive planning:

**Documentation Issues (TASK015 - FOUNDATION)**:
- âœ… **Plans scattered**: memory-bank/plans/ should be docs/plans/ (business docs vs AI context)
- âœ… **Naming chaos**: Mixed capitals, dashes, underscores across ~50+ files
- âœ… **Structure confusion**: Documentation spread across docs/, db/docs/, memory-bank/
- âœ… **SQL misplacement**: Root sql/ folder should be consolidated into db/ddl/
- ðŸš¨ **BLOCKING TASK014**: Need clean documentation foundation before database work

**Database Structure Issues (TASK014 - CRITICAL)**:
- âœ… Schema Analysis: Unified and harmonized throughout data model
- âœ… Movement Table Readiness: All infrastructure components available  
- âœ… Source Tables: FACT_ORDER_LIST and FM_orders_shipped with clean schemas
- âœ… Reconciliation: reconciliation_result with match metadata (needs match_group field)
- ðŸš¨ **BLOCKING TASK013**: Duplicate folders database/ (34 files) and db/ (110 files) must be consolidated

**Strategic Work Ready (TASK013 - HIGH IMPACT)**:
- Perfect synergy with existing reconciliation infrastructure and TASK001 cache patterns
- High business impact for point-in-time reporting and Power BI analytics
- Low technical risk due to additive approach building on proven patterns
- Implementation timeline: 2-3 weeks after foundation work completion

**BLOCKING CHAIN**: TASK015 â†’ TASK014 â†’ TASK013 (cannot skip steps)
