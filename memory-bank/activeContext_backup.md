# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**TASK001 - Implement Materialized Summary Tables**: CRITICAL performance optimization to fix "god query" bottleneck causing 2-5 second load times. This is the #1 blocker for MVP production readiness.

## Recent Changes
**January 27, 2025**: **MVP FOUNDATION STRATEGY APPROVED** - 3-phase approach focusing on production readiness first, then customer intelligence
**January 27, 2025**: **PLANS ORGANIZED** - Moved CUSTOMER_PROFILING_ANALYSIS_PLAN.md and MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to memory-bank/plans/
**August 3, 2025**: **MASTER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CREATED** - Comprehensive 4-phase plan based on HONEST_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md
**August 2, 2025**: **SYSTEM REVIEW COMPLETED** - Identified system is 90% complete, needs execution layer optimization

## Next Steps
**Immediate Focus**: PHASE 1 - PRODUCTION READINESS (Week 1-2)
- TASK001: Implement materialized summary tables with stored procedure refresh (<1 second queries)
- TASK002: Standardize UI formatting across tables (✅/❌ consistency)  
- TASK003: Database schema optimization with proper indexing

**Upcoming**: PHASE 2 - OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE (Week 3-4)
- TASK004: Drill-down investigation capabilities (3-click issue resolution)
- TASK005: Complete HITL workflow integration
- TASK006: Action-oriented issue resolution workflows

## Active Decisions and Considerations
**🎯 MVP FOUNDATION STRATEGY**: Focus on production readiness before expanding intelligence capabilities:
- **System Status**: 90% complete with excellent foundation - needs execution layer optimization
- **Critical Path**: TASK001 performance fix is #1 blocker for MVP production deployment
- **Customer Intelligence**: Defer full Customer Profiling Plan to Phase 3 (Week 5-8) as focused MVP

**� CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE**: Enhanced shipment summary query unsuitable for scale:
- Current: 2-5 seconds for 1,000 shipments  
- Projected: 30+ seconds for 10,000 shipments
- Solution: Pre-computed summary table with 20-50x performance improvement

**✅ STRONG FOUNDATION CONFIRMED**: Database design, matching logic, and configuration system are production-ready:
- Multi-layer matching (LAYER_0, LAYER_1, LAYER_2) business-aligned
- Comprehensive match metadata and audit trails  
- Customer-specific configuration working correctly

**📈 STRATEGIC APPROACH**: "Execution Layer Optimization" - fix performance and UI for immediate MVP rather than architectural overhaul
