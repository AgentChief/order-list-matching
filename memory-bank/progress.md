# Progress

## Current Status
**Overall Project Status:** 95% Complete - TASK001 (Materialized summary tables) is COMPLETE and validated (<1s query, 20-50x faster). System is production-ready for next UI integration phase.

## What's Working
- **Database Design**: Multi-layer matching schema with comprehensive audit trails
- **Matching Logic**: LAYER_0/LAYER_1/LAYER_2 approach handles exact → fuzzy → manual review
- **Configuration System**: Database-driven customer rules and field mapping
- **Streamlit UI**: Functional interface for match review and configuration
- **Enhanced Shipment Summary**: Row numbers, match indicators, confidence levels, consolidated layers (functionality complete)
- **Materialized Cache**: `shipment_summary_cache` table, `sp_refresh_shipment_summary_cache` procedure, and stats view deployed and validated (0.179s query, <1s target)

## Timeline of Progress
- **August 3, 2025**: TASK001 COMPLETED - Materialized cache deployed, performance validated (<1s query, 20-50x faster)
- **August 3, 2025**: Master Implementation Plan created - 4-phase approach to production readiness
- **August 2, 2025**: HONEST_SYSTEM_REVIEW completed - identified system 90% complete, needs performance optimization
- **August 2, 2025**: Root folder cleanup completed - proper file organization restored
- **July 31, 2025**: Database configuration system completed with Streamlit UI
- **July 30, 2025**: Repository restructure completed

## What's Left to Build
**PHASE 1 - PRODUCTION READINESS (Week 1-2):**
- ~~TASK001: Materialized summary tables (fix 2-5 second "god query" → <1 second)~~ ✅ COMPLETE
- TASK002: UI consistency standardization (✅/❌ vs ✓/✗ formatting) - NEXT
- TASK003: Database performance optimization

**PHASE 2 - OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE (Week 3-4):**
- TASK004: Drill-down investigation capabilities  
- TASK005: HITL workflow integration
- TASK006: Action-oriented issue resolution

**PHASE 3 - CUSTOMER INTELLIGENCE MVP (Week 5-8):**
- Customer Profiling Analysis Plan (focused MVP for top 10 customers)
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Intelligence-enhanced matching for key customers

## Known Issues and Risks
- **HIGH**: UI formatting inconsistencies causing user confusion
- **MEDIUM**: Missing drill-down capabilities for issue investigation
- **LOW**: No performance monitoring or alerting system

# Performance Milestone
- **August 3, 2025**: Materialized cache system validated: 0.179s query, 0.142s refresh, 0.148s stats view (all <1s)
- **Impact**: 20-50x faster than previous real-time aggregation. Ready for UI integration.
