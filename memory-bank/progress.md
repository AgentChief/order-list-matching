# Progress

## Current Status
**Overall Project Status:** 60% Complete - Core system operational with TASK001 performance breakthrough. Currently blocked by foundation issues (documentation/database cleanup) that must be resolved before strategic movement table implementation.

## What's Working
- **Database Design**: Multi-layer matching schema with comprehensive audit trails
- **Matching Logic**: LAYER_0/LAYER_1/LAYER_2 approach handles exact → fuzzy → manual review
- **Configuration System**: Database-driven customer rules and field mapping
- **Streamlit UI**: Functional interface for match review and configuration
- **Enhanced Shipment Summary**: Row numbers, match indicators, confidence levels, consolidated layers (functionality complete)
- **Materialized Cache**: `shipment_summary_cache` table, `sp_refresh_shipment_summary_cache` procedure, and stats view deployed and validated (0.179s query, <1s target)
- **Schema Architecture**: Unified dbt-style staging → intermediate → marts flow with harmonized fields

## Timeline of Progress
- **August 5, 2025**: TASK015 CREATED - Documentation foundation cleanup identified as critical blocker
- **August 5, 2025**: TASK014 CREATED - Database folder consolidation identified as critical blocker
- **August 5, 2025**: TASK013 schema analysis completed - Movement table design ready, blocked by foundation issues
- **August 3, 2025**: TASK001 COMPLETED - Materialized cache deployed, performance validated (<1s query, 20-50x faster)
- **August 3, 2025**: Master Implementation Plan created - 4-phase approach to production readiness
- **August 2, 2025**: HONEST_SYSTEM_REVIEW completed - identified system 90% complete, needs performance optimization
- **August 2, 2025**: Root folder cleanup completed - proper file organization restored
- **July 31, 2025**: Database configuration system completed with Streamlit UI
- **July 30, 2025**: Repository restructure completed

## What's Left to Build
**PHASE 0 - FOUNDATION CLEANUP (Week 1):**
- TASK015: Documentation foundation cleanup (establish docs structure, naming standards) - **BLOCKING ALL WORK**
- TASK014: Database folder consolidation (eliminate database/ vs db/ duplication) - **BLOCKING TASK013**

**PHASE 1 - STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION (Week 2-3):**  
- TASK013: Consolidated movement table implementation (event-driven unified reporting) - **HIGH BUSINESS IMPACT**
- TASK002: UI consistency standardization (✅/❌ vs ✓/✗ formatting)

**PHASE 2 - OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE (Week 4-5):**
- TASK003: Database performance optimization continuation
- TASK004: Drill-down investigation capabilities  
- TASK005: HITL workflow integration
- TASK006: Action-oriented issue resolution

**PHASE 3 - ADVANCED FEATURES (Week 6+):**
- TASK007: Performance monitoring dashboard
- TASK008: Advanced matching capabilities
- TASK009: Reporting & Business Intelligence enhancements

## Known Issues and Risks
- **CRITICAL**: Documentation scattered across memory-bank/plans/, docs/, db/docs/ with inconsistent naming
- **CRITICAL**: Database folder duplication (database/ vs db/) creates deployment and development risks
- **HIGH**: Strategic movement table implementation blocked by foundation issues
- **MEDIUM**: UI formatting inconsistencies causing user confusion
- **LOW**: Missing drill-down capabilities for issue investigation

## Performance Milestone
- **August 3, 2025**: Materialized cache system validated: 0.179s query, 0.142s refresh, 0.148s stats view (all <1s)
- **Impact**: 20-50x faster than previous real-time aggregation. Foundation for movement table implementation.

## Strategic Readiness
- **Movement Table Architecture**: Comprehensive design complete, ready for implementation after foundation cleanup
- **Business Impact**: Point-in-time reporting, Power BI analytics, open order book analysis
- **Technical Synergy**: Perfect alignment with existing reconciliation infrastructure and TASK001 patterns
