# Task 01 Addendum: Critical Duplication Issue Found

## üö® CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED

**Math Error:** 125 matches + 50 unmatched = 175 total, but input was 165 shipments  
**Root Cause:** Many-to-many matching creating duplicate records  
**Impact:** 10 extra records being generated, causing false match counts

## üîç ANALYSIS

The join is creating multiple matches when:
1. One order matches multiple shipments (same style, different sizes)
2. One shipment matches multiple orders (variant orders for same base item)

**Evidence:**
- Sample unmatched all have identical join column values: LSP24K59, 100 - ARCTIC, AIR, 4755
- These SHOULD match but don't, suggesting join logic issue
- Extra 10 records indicate some shipments are being duplicated in matches

## ‚úÖ REVISED FIX NEEDED

### Current Issue in match_exact.py
The problem is not just the leftover calculation, but the fundamental join logic creating duplicates.

### Solution Options:

**Option A: Prevent Duplicates in Join**
- Use first match only for each shipment
- Ensure 1:1 shipment to match relationship

**Option B: De-duplicate After Join**  
- Allow multiple matches but track unique shipments
- Remove duplicates from final results

**Option C: Enhanced Tracking**
- Track both order and shipment IDs
- Ensure each shipment appears only once in results

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

1. **Fix duplication** to ensure accurate counts
2. **Investigate join column values** for unmatched records
3. **Validate business logic** for one-to-many relationships
4. **Test with smaller dataset** to verify fix

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX

- Input: 165 shipments
- Matches: 115-125 (realistic range without duplicates)
- Unmatched: 40-50 (with clear reasons)
- Total: Exactly 165 (matches + unmatched)

**Status:** CRITICAL - requires immediate attention before proceeding to Task 02
