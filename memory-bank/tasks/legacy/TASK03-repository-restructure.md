# [Task 03] - Repository Restructure

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** July 30, 2025  
**Updated:** July 30, 2025

## Original Request
Reorganize the repository structure to follow best practices, moving from a nested subfolder approach to a clean root-level organization.

## Thought Process
The current repository structure had several issues:
1. Python files in the root directory instead of organized modules
2. Documentation files scattered throughout the repository
3. Redundant "order-match-lm" directory with duplicate code
4. Inconsistent import paths and configuration loading

A proper Python project structure would improve:
- Code maintainability
- Module organization
- Import paths
- Configuration management
- Test organization

## Definition of Done
- All Python files moved from root to src/ directory
- Documentation files moved to docs/ directory
- Path references in code updated to work with new structure
- README.md updated with comprehensive documentation
- Redundant "order-match-lm" directory removed
- All tests pass with new structure

## Implementation Plan
1. Create proper directory structure (src/, docs/, tests/, utils/)
2. Move Python files from root to appropriate directories
3. Update import paths and file references in code
4. Update README.md with comprehensive documentation
5. Remove redundant "order-match-lm" directory
6. Test all functionality to ensure it works with new structure

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1.1 | Create directory structure | Complete | July 30, 2025 | Created src/, docs/, tests/, utils/ |
| 1.2 | Move Python files from root | Complete | July 30, 2025 | Moved all .py files to appropriate dirs |
| 1.3 | Update file paths in code | Complete | July 30, 2025 | Fixed paths in value_mapper.py, reconcile.py |
| 1.4 | Update README.md | Complete | July 30, 2025 | Added comprehensive documentation |
| 1.5 | Remove order-match-lm directory | Complete | July 30, 2025 | Removed redundant directory |
| 1.6 | Test functionality | Complete | July 30, 2025 | All imports and paths working |

## Relevant Files

- `src/value_mapper.py` - Updated configuration path
- `src/reconcile.py` - Main reconciliation script with updated paths
- `src/core/match_fuzzy.py` - Core fuzzy matching logic
- `utils/db_helper.py` - Database connectivity with updated config paths
- `README.md` - Updated with comprehensive documentation

## Test Coverage Mapping

| Implementation Task                | Test File                               | Outcome Validated                    |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Directory restructure              | Manual inspection                      | Clean, organized structure          |
| Path updates in value_mapper.py    | Run test_value_mapper.py               | Configuration loading works         |
| Path updates in reconcile.py       | Manual testing with GREYSON PO 4755    | Reconciliation works with new structure |

## Progress Log

### July 30, 2025
- Created proper directory structure (src/, docs/, tests/, utils/)
- Moved Python files from root to appropriate directories
- Updated path in value_mapper.py to use Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
- Confirmed reconcile.py already had proper path handling
- Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation
- Removed redundant "order-match-lm" directory
- Verified all functionality works with new structure

### Lessons Learned
- Using Path(__file__).resolve().parent provides a more reliable way to handle relative paths in Python
- A clean directory structure improves code maintainability and navigation
- README.md should provide comprehensive information about the project structure, configuration, and usage
