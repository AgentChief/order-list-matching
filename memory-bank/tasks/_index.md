## Implementation Phases

### üî• Phase 1: Critical Performance & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
**TASK001, TASK002, TASK003** - Fix foundation issues blocking production

### üéØ Phase 2: Workflow Completion (Week 3-4)  
**TASK004, TASK005, TASK006** - Complete user journeys and workflows

### üîß Phase 3: Advanced Features & Monitoring (Week 5-6)
**TASK007, TASK008, TASK009** - Production excellence and monitoring

### üìà Phase 4: Scale & Future Features (Week 7-8+)
**TASK010, TASK011, TASK012** - Enterprise architecture and ML enhancement
