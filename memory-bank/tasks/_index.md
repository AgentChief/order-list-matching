## Implementation Phases

### ï¿½ Phase 0: Foundation Cleanup (Week 1)
**TASK015, TASK014** - Critical foundation issues blocking all strategic work

### ðŸš€ Phase 1: Strategic Implementation (Week 2-3)  
**TASK013, TASK002** - Movement table and UI consistency for production readiness

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Workflow Completion (Week 4-5)  
**TASK003, TASK004, TASK005, TASK006** - Complete user journeys and workflows

### ðŸ”§ Phase 3: Advanced Features & Monitoring (Week 6-7)
**TASK007, TASK008, TASK009** - Production excellence and monitoring

### ðŸ“ˆ Phase 4: Scale & Future Features (Week 8+)
**TASK010, TASK011, TASK012** - Enterprise architecture and ML enhancement

## Current Focus: **TASK015 â†’ TASK014 â†’ TASK013**
**CRITICAL PATH**: Documentation foundation â†’ Database consolidation â†’ Movement table implementation

**Next Action:** Execute TASK015 documentation cleanup to establish proper foundation for all subsequent work.

**BLOCKING CHAIN**: 
- TASK015 blocks TASK014 (need clean docs structure for database consolidation)
- TASK014 blocks TASK013 (need single database folder for movement table)
- TASK013 unlocks strategic BI capabilities
