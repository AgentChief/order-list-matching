# TASK003 - System Performance and Architecture Optimization

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** August 2, 2025  
**Updated:** August 2, 2025

## Original Request
Following comprehensive system review, address critical performance bottlenecks and architectural improvements. User identified complex query performance issues and requested system-wide optimization focusing on:
1. Complex "god query" optimization for shipment summary
2. UI consistency standardization  
3. Stored procedure implementation for performance
4. File organization and root folder cleanup

## Thought Process
Based on HONEST_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md analysis, the system is "90% there" but needs execution layer optimization. Key findings:
- Enhanced shipment summary query works but unsuitable for scale (2-5 seconds for 1000 records)
- UI inconsistencies between tables (✅/❌ vs ✓/✗ symbols)
- Root folder organization violations despite clear instructions
- Need for materialized summary approach with stored procedures

## Definition of Done

- All code implementation tasks have corresponding validation tests
- Performance improvements verified with realistic data volumes
- UI consistency maintained across all table components
- Root folder cleaned up with proper file organization
- Stored procedure implementation delivers <1 second query performance
- All business-critical paths covered by integration tests

## Implementation Plan
1. **Immediate: Root folder cleanup** - Move misplaced files to proper directories per instructions
2. **Performance optimization** - Implement materialized summary table with stored procedure refresh
3. **UI standardization** - Create shared formatting functions for consistent symbols
4. **Architecture improvements** - Implement recommended stored procedure-first approach
5. **Testing and validation** - Verify performance gains and functionality preservation

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 30%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 6.1 | Clean up root folder organization | Complete | Aug 2 | Moved all files to proper directories per instructions |
| 6.2 | Implement materialized summary table | Not Started | Aug 2 | Create sp_refresh_shipment_summary_cache |
| 6.3 | Standardize UI formatting functions | Not Started | Aug 2 | Resolve ✅/❌ vs ✓/✗ inconsistency |
| 6.4 | Create performance monitoring dashboard | Not Started | Aug 2 | Track query execution times |
| 6.5 | Validate performance improvements | Not Started | Aug 2 | Test with realistic data volumes |

## Relevant Files

- `HONEST_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md` - Comprehensive system analysis (needs proper location)
- `src/ui/streamlit_config_app.py` - Main UI requiring formatting standardization
- `tests/debug/debug_data_flow.py` - Enhanced query testing and validation
- `src/database/` - Target location for stored procedure implementations
- `src/ui/components/` - Target location for shared formatting functions

## Test Coverage Mapping

| Implementation Task | Test File | Outcome Validated |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Materialized summary table | tests/performance/test_summary_performance.py | <1 second query execution |
| UI formatting functions | tests/ui/test_formatting_consistency.py | Consistent symbols across tables |
| Stored procedure implementation | tests/database/test_stored_procedures.py | Correct business logic preservation |
| Root folder organization | tests/structure/test_file_organization.py | Compliance with project structure |

## Progress Log
### August 2, 2025
- Created task following comprehensive system review
- Identified critical performance and organization issues
- User correctly pointed out root folder violations despite clear instructions
- **COMPLETED: Root folder cleanup** - Moved all misplaced files to proper directories:
  - Documentation: `HONEST_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md`, `MATCHING_DEBUG_FINDINGS.md`, etc. → `docs/`
  - Database scripts: `setup_hitl_db.py`, `setup_config_db.py`, etc. → `scripts/database/`
  - Test files: `test_*.py` → `tests/integration/`
  - Utility scripts: analysis and processing scripts → `scripts/utilities/`
  - Data files: CSV files → `data/legacy/`
  - Config files: YAML files → `config/`
  - Auth helper: `auth_helper.py` → `src/database/`
- Repository now complies with project structure requirements
- Ready to proceed with performance optimization implementation
