# TASK013: Movement Table + Matching Layer Enhancement Plan

## Implementation Overview

**Goal**: Complete the data engineering system with unified movement table for reporting and consolidate Streamlit interfaces into one incredible interface.

## Phase 1: Movement Table Implementation

### 1.1 Database Schema Enhancement

**Add movement table for unified reporting:**
- `fact_order_movements` table for event-driven reporting
- Add `match_group` field to `reconciliation_result` table
- Implement point-in-time reporting capabilities
- Support for Power BI analytics and open order book analysis

### 1.2 Movement Table Features
- **Event-driven structure**: Track order lifecycle events
- **Point-in-time reporting**: Historical state reconstruction
- **Split shipment tracking**: Handle multiple shipments per order
- **Status transitions**: Order → Packed → Shipped → Delivered
- **Analytics support**: Pre-aggregated views for reporting

## Phase 2: Matching Layer Enhancement

### 2.1 Enhanced Matching Algorithm
- **Layer 0**: Exact matching with improved canonicalization
- **Layer 1**: Fuzzy matching with style+color exact requirement
- **Layer 2**: Deep fuzzy matching for data variations
- **Layer 3**: Quantity resolution and split shipment detection

### 2.2 Performance Optimization
- Build on existing materialized cache (TASK001)
- Improve match confidence scoring
- Enhanced split shipment detection
- Better quantity variance handling

## Phase 3: Streamlit Interface Consolidation

### 3.1 Unified Interface Architecture
- **Main Dashboard**: System overview with real-time metrics
- **HITL Review**: Human-in-the-loop matching review
- **Configuration Management**: Customer and mapping configuration
- **Movement Analytics**: Order movement tracking and reporting
- **Admin Tools**: System maintenance and monitoring

### 3.2 Enhanced UI Features
- **Layer-based Review**: Review matches by confidence layer
- **Bulk Operations**: Approve/reject multiple matches
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live system performance dashboard
- **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-dimensional data filtering
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV/Excel export for analysis

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Movement Table Schema
1. Create `fact_order_movements` table
2. Add `match_group` field to reconciliation tables
3. Create supporting views and procedures
4. Add indexes for performance

### Step 2: Implement Movement Logic
1. Create movement tracking procedures
2. Implement event capture logic
3. Build reporting aggregations
4. Test with sample data

### Step 3: Enhance Matching Layer
1. Improve Layer 0-2 matching algorithms
2. Add Layer 3 quantity resolution
3. Enhanced split shipment detection
4. Better confidence scoring

### Step 4: Consolidate Streamlit Interfaces
1. Create unified main application
2. Implement tab-based navigation
3. Integrate all existing functionality
4. Enhanced UI/UX design
5. Add new movement analytics tab

### Step 5: Testing & Validation
1. End-to-end testing of movement table
2. Matching algorithm validation
3. UI functionality testing
4. Performance benchmarking
5. User acceptance testing

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- Movement table captures all order lifecycle events
- Match rates improve to 90%+ exact, 95%+ total
- Interface consolidation maintains all functionality
- Performance targets met (<1s query times)

### Business Success
