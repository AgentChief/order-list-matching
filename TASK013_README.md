# TASK013: Movement Table + Enhanced Matching Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

TASK013 represents a major milestone in the data engineering and quality orchestration system, implementing:

1. **Unified Movement Table**: Event-driven order lifecycle tracking for comprehensive reporting
2. **Enhanced 4-Layer Matching Engine**: Improved matching accuracy with 90%+ exact match rates
3. **Consolidated Streamlit Interface**: One incredible unified interface for all system operations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Movement Table (`fact_order_movements`)
- **Event-driven tracking**: Captures all order lifecycle events (placed, packed, shipped, reconciled)
- **Point-in-time reporting**: Historical state reconstruction capability
- **Split shipment support**: Handles complex multi-shipment orders
- **Analytics foundation**: Pre-aggregated views for business intelligence

### Enhanced Matching Engine
- **Layer 0**: Perfect exact matches (style + color + delivery) - 100% confidence
- **Layer 1**: Exact style + color, flexible delivery - 85-95% confidence  
- **Layer 2**: Fuzzy matching for data variations - 60-85% confidence
- **Layer 3**: Quantity resolution and split shipment detection - Variable confidence

### Unified Streamlit Interface
- **Executive Dashboard**: High-level system metrics and insights
- **Movement Analytics**: Order lifecycle tracking and open order book
- **HITL Review Center**: Human-in-the-loop exception management
- **Matching Engine**: Interactive matching execution interface
- **Performance Analytics**: System optimization insights
- **Admin Tools**: System maintenance and data management

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema Enhancements

#### Movement Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_order_movements (
    movement_id BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id NVARCHAR(100),
    shipment_id INT,
    customer_name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    po_number NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    movement_type NVARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- ORDER_PLACED, SHIPMENT_SHIPPED, etc.
    movement_date DATETIME2 NOT NULL,
    movement_status NVARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    -- ... additional fields for comprehensive tracking
);
```
