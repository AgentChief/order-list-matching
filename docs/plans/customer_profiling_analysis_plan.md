# Customer Profiling Analysis Plan

**Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive customer intelligence system for bulk analysis of garment patterns, delivery methods, PO usage, and matching optimization  
**Status:** Design Phase  

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive Customer Profiling Analysis System that will automatically analyze every customer in our database to learn garment patterns, delivery method preferences, PO usage patterns, and matching behaviors. The system will enhance our order-list matching accuracy by providing customer-specific intelligence and reducing manual exception management.
